## 最好的复仇

From:&nbsp; [What was the best revenge you've ever gotten?](http://qr.ae/TUGGcK)

Date: September 26 2018

It wasn’t me, but a college buddy. But it was so sweet, I have to share.

> 不是我,是我大学里面的一个老铁.但这复仇太甜了(怀疑是狗粮,认真脸),我必须要分享出来.

There was a really beautiful, popular girl my friend, call him Mike, had a serious crush on. He asked her out several times but she was always “busy”. She never really discouraged him though, I think she liked the attention.

> 有一个很漂亮且很受人待见的女孩子,我的老铁,就叫他 Mike 吧,超级喜欢她的.他想约她出去很多次了,但那个女孩子的回复一直是"忙,不约,不约".
> 她从来没有明确的拒绝他,我想她是喜欢获取他的注意吧(备胎 Queue).

One day Mike got ahold of two tickets to a sold out U2 concert. He bought them from a friend who had to go out of town for an emergency.

> 有一天,Mike 拿着两张 U2 的演唱会门票.他从一个临时有急事出外的朋友那里买的.

Mike immediately called the girl of his dreams and of course she accepted. He was thrilled and everything seemed fine.

> Mike 立即打电话给那个他梦里的女孩子,当然那个女孩子接受了.他当然很激动啦,而且所有的事情看起来都往好的方面发展了.(莱纳德的孩子).

The night of the concert they’re at the arena waiting for the show to begin and she suddenly says, “Oh, I see my friend, I’ll be right back!”

> 在演唱会的那晚,他们在舞台前等待着演唱会开始,然后那个女孩子说,"窝草,我看到我的朋友了,我一会再回来!"

You guessed it, she never returned. Mike stayed at the seats since that’s the only place she would logically look for him. When the show ended, Mike ever the gentleman, waited for a long time so he could drive her home. But saw no sign of her. She didn’t answer her phone or texts. So he left feeling so hurt.

> 你猜发生了什么,她根本没再回来.Mike 坐在那里

By the next morning he was rightfully pissed! She called him around noon apologizing and saying she ran into her ex they had a long talk and worked out a lot of stuff and lost track of time. She had actually missed the concert and blah, blah, blah.

> 第二天早上,他正在恼怒的时候.那个女孩子打电话来了,没有一句道歉,然后告诉他,她看见了她的前男友,然后双方展开了一次深刻的对话,解决了很多历史遗留问题以及在人海中重逢.她真的很想念这场音乐会,bla,bla,bla...

He accepted her apology and asked if they could try again. She accepted and told him how very nice and forgiving he was. She had underestimated him!

> 他接受了她的道歉,然后邀请她在出去一次.她接受了,然后给他发好人卡和告诉他是个绝世好男人.但她低估他了.

So the next Saturday evening he took her to a very expensive seafood restaurant about an hour up the coast. He was polite and chatty the whole way up there. He made the reservation in her name.

> 所以第二个星期六晚上,他带她去一个离海边不远的很贵的海鲜餐厅.他很礼貌而且说了很多话,在一路上.他用了她的名字来订餐.

They were seated, ordered a nice bottle of wine, some expensive appetizers and entrees, then Mike excused himself to go to the men’s room. He very deliberately said, “I’ll be right back.”

> 他们入座,点了上好的红酒啦,一些很贵的小菜和主餐,然后 Mike 说他要去厕所啦,他甚至故意的说,"我一会回来."

He walked out to the parking lot and drove away. And became the hero of every good guy who’s been treated like crap by a girl because she just didn’t give a damn about his feelings.

> 他走到停车场,然后回去了.然后成为每一个曾经被那些女孩子当做垃圾对待的备胎的榜样,因为她根本没在乎他的感觉.

I still love that story!!

> 我超喜欢这个故事的.

## 生涯最尬时刻

From:&nbsp; [What is your most embarrassing moment at school?](http://qr.ae/TUGt9E)

Date: September 27 2018

Not mine, but a girl that went to my school.

> 不是我,是一个转来我们学校的女孩子.

One day, out of the blue, this one girl started getting a bigger and bigger stomach. The students noticed pretty quickly, and so did the teachers.

> 那一天,在外边,那个女孩子开始了一阵又一阵的胃痛.那些同学和老师很快意识到她不舒服.

This girl wasn’t exactly a model student. She was pretty well known for partying and drinking and messing around with a lot of different guys.

> 那个女孩子不是颜值逆天的那种学生.众所周知,她喜欢聚会啦,喝酒啦,然后和一堆男的混在一起.

So everyone, including the teachers, realized that she was pregnant.

> 所以每一个人,包括老师,都知道她怀孕了.

She didn’t do a very good job hiding it, and pretty much everyone in the school knew about it. Whenever she walked into the room, there were a lot of whispers among the students. Even the teachers gossiped about her.

> 她没能太好的隐藏这个迹象,所以每一个在学校里面的人都知道了这个消息.不论何时她走进教室里面,学生都在那里议论纷纷.甚至那些老师都有点八卦了.

Eventually, the counselors caught wind of it. They brought in a teenage pregnancy specialist and called the girl in to talk.

> 最后,辅导主任闻到了风.他们带来了早孕的专家然后叫那个女孩子来询问情况.

Imagine their surprise, when they asked the girl what she was planning to do with the baby, and she responded “What baby?”

> 想象一下他们吃惊的表情,当他们问到那个女孩子有什么关于小屁孩的计划的时候,然后那个女孩子说"什么孩子?" 我没有,不知道,别瞎说.jpg

It turns out the girl wasn’t pregnant, she was just really fat.

> 发现那个女孩子并没有怀孕,而仅仅是因为她比较胖而已.

She recently had a messy breakup with her boyfriend and had stopped caring about her health. She used food to deal with her emotions.

> 她最近和她男朋友闹分手,然后对自己的健康一点也不注意.她把悲愤化作力量消灭食物.

Long story short, her stomach was filled with Doritos, not a baby.

> 长话短说,她的胃全是薯片,而不是小屁孩.

The school was extremely embarrassed and tried to cover it up, but completely failed. The entire student body found out.

> 学校觉得很丢脸了,然后尝试去掩盖这件事,但绝壁失败了.整个学校都知道了整件事.

The next year, she transferred schools.

> 第二年,她转校了.

I can’t really blame her.

> 我不能怪她,哈,哈,哈.

## 人生最难放弃的是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What's the hardest thing to give up in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGvU1)

Date: September 28 2018

I have a friend who says her boyfriend has stopped loving her. She tells me every boyfriend she has ever had has stopped loving her. She assures me there is something wrong with her.

> 我有一个朋友说她的男朋友不在喜欢她了.她告诉我她之前的每一个男朋友到最后都不喜欢她了.她像我确认是不是她做错了什么.

Her boyfriend is a friend of mine. His mom died a few months ago and he is mourning.

> 她的男朋友也是我的一个朋友.他的老妈在几个月前去世了,而他现在都还没走出悲伤中去.

What he tells me is that he loves this woman, but that the grief he is managing is too big and is crowding out everything else.

> 他告诉我他还喜欢那个那孩子,但是他要办一个葬礼的太重要,以至于掩盖了生活中的其他事物.

Her insecurity and her insistence that he does not love her is proving too much for him to handle.

> 她的不安和强调他不再喜欢她了,正好说好他现在手上的事情太多了.

I really want to mind my own business but I do try to tell my friend that what her boyfriend is going through has nothing to do with her or his love for her.

> 我很想只管我自己的屁事,但我想去告诉我的朋友,她男朋友现在需要经历的东西和她一点关系也没有,或者告诉她,他还喜欢她.

She shakes her head. She does not want to hear me.

> 她摇了摇头.然后不再想听我说了.

The hardest thing to give up is the thing we have decided to believe.

> 生命里,最难放弃的应该我们曾坚信的东西吧.
