## 永远不要对程序猿说什么?
From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[How do I deal with ....?](What should you never say to a programmer?)


Date: November 22 2017



“I have a great idea for a startup! So we should make an app that…

<insert an idea here which is already on the market/impossible to implement/really stupid/useful for only 14 people around the world>
What do you think? Totally awesome right? So anyway, I am looking for a coder who will do the programming, shouldn’t take much time. I will be the CEO, doing the hard work, you know, talking with real people, you nerds can’t do that. How about we split the profit 80%–20%? I think it is generous!”

> "关于起步项目,我有一个很好的主意.我们应该弄一个app...



><这里面就是那个主意在app商店里面已经存在了/不可能去扩展的/蠢到爆炸的/全球可能只有14个人会使用的>你觉得怎么样?是不是很牛掰,很厉害? 所以,我在找一个能编程,而又不在开发中耗费很多时间的程序猿.我会成为CEO,做最艰难的工作,你知道的,和那些客户交流,你们这些死宅是做不来的.不如我们8/2分成,我8,你2?我想这是极好的!"

We hate that. And guess what, we can talk to people, we just don’t like to :D

> 程序猿痛恨这个.你知道吗?我们可以和客户交流,只是不喜欢那样子做而已.





## 有哪一时刻发生在你生活中你觉得只会发生在电影里面的场景?
From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is one moment in your life you thought could only happen in a movie?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-moment-in-your-life-you-thought-could-only-happen-in-a-movie/answers/67374227?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: November 25 2017



I was in the midst of an extremely stressful year, sudden unexpected job loss, deaths in the family, life was just a big meteor plowing me into oblivion.

> 我当时处于压力非常大的一年之中.意外的失去工作,家庭成员逝世,生活就像一颗流星把我摧毁堙没.

I did my best to keep my chin up and try and be the strong one. I filled out job applications, comforted family, and tried to get back to living again. But, I wasn't eating, couldn't sleep. Just a total mess. I kept reassuring myself that it would pass. Each night that thought would shut my mind off at night enough to pass out in a pool of emotional exhaustion. Until that one crazy night..

> 我尽我最大的努力去面对困难(chin up==face up?),尝试去变得坚强一点.我填写了工作申请,安抚家庭,然后想回到正常生活里面.但,我吃不下,睡不着.心绪乱成一团.我继续安慰我自己说这些都会过去的.每一晚这种想法都会阻塞我的内心,让我精疲力尽.直到那一个不寻常的夜晚...

I woke up the next afternoon in the hospital and had no clue why I was there. A strange man was sitting in a chair by my feet. As my eyes opened, he walked into the hallway to get the attention of a nurse. She asked if I was feeling alright. I nodded with a foggy head. She said she would be back in a minute before disappearing.

> 第二天下午,我在医院醒来,我不知道会在医院里面,一点线索也没有.一个陌生的男人坐在我脚边的凳子上面.在我睁开眼睛的时候,他走到走廊去叫护士.护士问我是否还好.我脑子一片糊涂的点了点头.她说她一会再回来.

I looked around and asked the man sitting there if I knew him from somewhere. He only said that we had met the previous night. And then I suddenly realized I could not remember anything at all.

> 我望向四周,问那个男人是不是我在哪里认识他(500年前是一家?).他仅仅说我们在昨晚才遇见的.然后,我意识到我不记得关于昨晚的任何事情了.

While trying to put the pieces together, the nurse walked in with another man. A psychiatrist.

> 当我尝试整理思绪的时候,那个护士带着另一个男的进来了,一个精神科医生.

To make a long story short, although I have no recollection of the journey, I had walked in my sleep to the roof of the hospital parking garage about a half mile away. Sound asleep. As I was walking along a knee high railing 6 stories above nothing but concrete, the security guard now sitting at my feet was doing a random check of the lot and pulled me off the edge.

> 简而言之,尽管我回忆不起那晚经历了什么,我梦游走到半里外的医院的停车场的屋顶.听起来是睡着了.当我走在膝盖高毫无保护的混凝土栏杆上的时候,现在坐在我脚边的那个安保人员正在随机巡逻,然后把我拉下来了.

A complete stranger saved my life, and then sat there for 15 hours just to be the one to welcome me back to the land of the living.

> 一个陌生人救了我,然后他坐在那里15个小时,就为了成为欢迎我回归生活的一员.

A week in the hospital, some much needed temporary medication, extensive stress management and grief therapy. I am whole again and doing well.

> 入院一周后,需要一些暂时的药物治疗,压力管控和痛苦治疗.我恢复了而且恢复得还不错.

That was 12 years ago. Every few months I bring security guard Ted a cup of coffee and sit on the roof of that same garage (it is now fenced in) to share a couple doughnuts and a brief conversation of gratitude. He is the most humble, kind-hearted person I have ever met.

> 那是12年前.每隔几个月,我都会给保安Ted一杯咖啡,坐在同一个车库的屋顶上(现在建立了围墙)去分析一些糕点和一会怀着感激之情的交谈.Ted是我见过最谦虚,最热心的人了.

If you are reading this, thanks Ted. Thank you for my life.

> 如果你看见这个,谢谢你Ted.谢谢你为我做的一切.

P.S. We both know I owe you so much more than coffee and a snack, but you just have be stubborn about it!

> Ps 我们都知道我欠你远不止一杯咖啡和小吃,但你坚持你只要这些.

Or finds out you have a nice body when they take your clothes off. Not because you wear skin-tight clothes every day.

From:  [What is the best thing you read today?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thing-you-read-today/answer/AnandBhushan-Singh?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: November 27 2017



A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much.

> 他娶了一个漂亮的女孩子围妻子.他非常爱她.

One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour.

> 一天她得了一种皮肤病.慢慢的,她开始失去她的容颜.这是都是在她丈夫出去旅行的那一天开始的.

While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually.

> 当他回来的时候,他遇到了一场意外,同时失去了他的视力.不论怎样,他们的婚姻得以和往常一样继续下去.伴随时光消逝,她逐渐失去她美丽的容颜.

Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life.

> 失去视力的丈夫不知道这个问题,然后妻子容貌的改变并没有让他们的婚姻有什么和之前不一样的.

He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him great sorrow.

> 他们彼此深爱对方.一天,她逝世了.她的逝世给他带来了深深的悲伤.

He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you. He replied, I am not blind.

> 当他完成葬礼的最后一个仪式,他想要离开这个镇子.一个站在他背后的男人对他说,现在你还能自己一个人出外吗?之前都是你的妻子来帮助你的.他回答到,我不是盲人.

I was acting, because if she knew l could see her ugliness it would have pained her more than her disease. So I pretended to be blind.

> 我是扮的,因为如果她知道我可以看见她的不美丽的一面,这会给她比病更多的痛苦.所以我假装我是盲的.

She was a very good wife. I only wanted to keep her happy.

> 她是一个非常,非常,非常好的妻子.我只想让她幸福.

Moral: Some times it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings, in order to be happy. No matter how many times the teeth bite the tongue, they still stay together in one mouth. That's the spirit of FORGIVENESS.

> 寓意:某些时候,对于其他人的短处,我们装作看不见是对于彼此都好的一件事.不论牙齿把舌头咬了多少次,但它们一直都是待在一起的.这就是原谅的力量.(What,我的语文是体育老师教的,还是你的是?)

May God grant us all the spirit of forgiveness, unity and togetherness.

> 愿Blabla赐予我们所有关于原谅,团结和欢聚的力量.





## 收到过最好的礼物?
From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the best gift that somebody has ever received?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-gift-that-somebody-has-ever-received/answer/Kevin-Layton-2?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: November 28 2017



My Dad bought me a brand new Jeep Wrangler when I was 17, but the real gift was what he taught me about life by way of this car. Every month, on the first of the month, I was required to pay him  150 if I wanted to continue driving my Jeep. If I didn’t pay, I couldn’t drive my car (or “his car”, as he often reminded me, since he owned the title). My Dad was (and still is) a successful businessman, who makes a very decent living. To a 17-year old working part-time in High School, 150 was more than I usually had in my bank account, and I often struggled with the prospect of handing over 150 when the time came to pay the piper. Although it was often done begrudgingly and with much complaining, I always made sure to have 150 in his hand on the first of the month, and did so for 2 years.

> 在我17岁的时候,我爸给我买了一辆新的吉普车,但真正礼物是他通过这辆车教给我的东西.每一个月,在月初,如果我想要开那辆车,我就要被要求交150美元的费用.如果我不交,我不能驾驶那辆车(或者说是他的车,就像他经常提起的那样,从他拥有那车的归属权).我爸曾经是(现在也还是)一个成功的商人,有着十分得体的生活.对于一个17岁在高中里面兼职的人,150美元通常比我在银行里面的存款还多,而我经常挣扎在把150美元交到他那里来换取一个月的驾驶权的场景.尽管这通常带来很多关于吝啬的埋怨.我得一直确保我有150美元在每个月的开始交给他,而且这样做了2年.

The day I graduated High School, my Dad pulled me into his office at our house, and sat me down for a little chat. “Kevin” he said, extending his arm to give me a white, sealed envelope, “here is your graduation present. Although to be fair, this is technically a present from yourself.” I opened the envelope with caution, and almost started crying when I realized he just gave me $3,600 in cash, or the equivalent of 24 car payments that he had been saving for the last 2 years. Every payment I gave him went straight into this envelope, to be opened upon my graduation. By forcing me to pay him every month, he was teaching me how to save, how to manage my money, how to find and hold a job, how to be responsible. My Dad is and will forever be the best man I have ever known.

> 当我高中毕业的那天,我爸把我拉到他在家中的办公室里面,然后坐下来交谈一会."Kevin",他说,把他的手伸过来递给我一个白色,密封的信封,"这个是你的毕业礼物.说句公道话,这个礼物实际是你自己送给你自己的."我小心的打开那个信封,我差点哭出来了,当我意识到他给我3600美元的现金的时候,或者等于他保存了2年,我24个月的车费.每一次我给他的钱,他都直接放到那个信封里面,为了在我毕业的时候才打开.为了强迫我每个月缴费,他是在教我怎么存钱,怎么去管理,怎么去找和保住一份工作,怎么承担责任.我爸是我认识中最好的男人.

Edit: He gave me the title for the Jeep 4 years later, as my college graduation present :)

> 更新:在四年后,他把那辆车的归属权给了我,在我大学毕业的时候

Edit #2: 20,000+ upvotes?! I’m humbled by the response and appreciate everyone’s kind words…thank you all!

> 更新2: 20k+点赞?!我被你们的留言击败了,同时感谢你们每一位的热心留言.谢谢各位父老乡亲.

The best gift a parent can give their child is an email id.

## 怎么发现一个人是不是聪明?
From:  [How can people spot an intelligent person?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-people-spot-an-intelligent-person/answers/68070917?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: January 03 2018



There was this girl in my class (going anonymous cause she follows me on Quora) who was very intelligent.

> 我们班有这么一个女孩(匿名是因为她在Quora上关注了我),一个十分聪明的女孩子.

She was a social person and a mix between extravert and introvert.

> 她是一个喜欢社交的人,能在外向和内向的群体都混得开的人.

In physics, she would spot mistakes the teacher made and would fidget in her seat with a grin waiting for the teacher to finish and quietly ask a question to point out the mistake. She never directly said “Hey Mister, you made a mistake.” She would try as much as possible not to embarrass the teacher and it worked because often times she would ask a question to a teacher so he/she would notice his or her own mistake.

> 在物理课上,她能认出老师的错误,然后面带微笑不安的坐在座位上,等待老师完成之后,然后提出疑问去引出老师的错误.她从来不直接说"老师,你犯了一个错."她努力不让那个老师觉得尴尬,而这都行之有效,因为许多次她向老师提问问题后,老师们都意识到自己的错误了.

She had this charm to her. She knew a lot about a lot.

> 她很有魅力呀.她知道一堆的东西关于一堆东西(Harry Potter里面的Hermione,微笑)

At first sight she doesn't seem like the smart one. She can make everyone laugh and didn't really nerd out like the other smart kids.

> 对于她的第一印象,她看起来并不像聪明的人.她很幽默而且不像其他聪明的人一些宅.

One time, the class was discussing stuff and somehow came to the topic of the Center of North America. Everyone tried to guess and after everyone tried deducing she waited till everyone was quiet and said “Its a place in North Dakota called Rugby.” And proceeded to describe its origins of this place.

> 一次,班里面在讨论一些东西,不知道怎样就扯到了关于南美中部的话题.每一个人都努力的去尝试,她等所有人推断结束后,然后说:"这是一个叫Rugby在North Dakota的地方."然后开始描述这个地方的来源历史.

Like I said, she knew a lot about a lot.

> 就像我说的,我知道一堆的东西关于一堆的东西.

Killed her Science fair project and managed to take the laziest kids in the class and won first place in the school. I am telling you that those kids have never passed a singe test in any Science course.

> 放弃她自己的科研项目去帮助班里面最懒的小屁孩去赢得他们在学校的第一个奖励.我告诉你,那些小屁孩从没有通过一科科学的考试.

Every guy had a crush on her even though she was not as pretty as the other girls who got straight A’s. She was not a straight A student and got B’s and even C’s.

> 每个人对她都有心中的老狗砰砰乱撞的时候,即使她没有其他那些全优女孩子那么漂亮.她不是全优的学生,有时候会拿到B,甚至是C.

She says she hates English class but was one of the people who scored highest on state exams.

> 她说她不喜欢英语课却成为在洲测试里面拿最高分的人(死学霸,鉴定完毕)

All the girls were jealous of her. She didn't try to be smart like the others did . She had it in her already.

> 其他的女孩子全都妒忌她.她没尝试过去想其他人那么聪明.她已经很聪明了.

I loved coding and when we sat in class, she would see me code all the time. I had a problem with a program I was working on and she asked me if she could borrow the laptop. Fixed it in 5 minutes. That was the day i realized that she was proficient in 3 programming languages. She watched me code almost all the time and never bothered to tell me.

> 当我们坐在班级里面,我喜欢编程,她一直都在看我编程.有一个bug在我正在写的代码上,她问我可不可以借一下我的笔记本.然后5分钟就搞定了.就在那天,我知道她精通3门编程语言.她一直在看我编程而从来都没打搅我.(她&&编程==amazing)

I guess thats why everyone loved her.

> 我想这就是每个人都喜欢她吧.

You could tell when someone is intelligent just by the way he/she acts.

> 你可以通过那些人的行为来辨别他们是否聪明.

I pressed the button for floor number thirteen. The only other occupants of the lift were two cute girls, who were talking to each other in a highly fake American accent.

> 我按下去13楼的按钮.有两个可爱的女孩子和我在电梯里面,她们相互说着那种很假的美国口音.

At the fifth floor, the lift stopped, the door opened, and I was surprised to see an African man standing in front of us. True that Delhi is a favorite destination of international tourists, but people of African origin are still a rare sight.

> 在第五层,电梯停了,然后电梯门开了,我对一个非洲男人站在电梯门前感到惊讶.虽然新德里是国际旅客喜欢的旅游地点,但来自非洲的旅客还是很少见到的.


The lift was again on its way.

> 然后电梯继续上升.

I turned my attention back to the girls. Suddenly, one of them started signaling the other, making big round eyes, first pointing towards her, and then towards the African guy. For an instant, the second girl seemed confused, but then she realized what her friend was trying to point to and both of them burst with silent giggles. I felt really bad for the African guy, who seemed strangely calm. He didn’t seem to mind at all. Emboldened by this, the two girls began talking loudly, but this time, they strategically switched to Hindi.

> 我把注意力重新转到那两个女孩子身上.突然,其中一个女孩子给另一个女孩子信号,差不多翻白眼一样的滚动眼睛,望向她的朋友,然后望向那个非洲同胞.刚开始,另一个女孩子看起来有点疑惑,然后她明白指什么之后,她们两个爆发出一阵低沉的猪叫般的笑声.我为那个非洲同胞感到难过,但他看起来很冷静.他好像一点也不介意.在这个怂恿下,她们开始说得更大声了,但这之后的讨论,她们战略性的换成印度语了.

“Kitna bhadda lag raha hai ye kalua!” (He’s so ugly, this Blackie!)

> "Bla bla bla"(这个黑人,太丑了)

“Haan, sahi kaha. Baal dekh iske, jaise ghungrali ghas ugi ho sir pe.” (Yep, you’re right. Look at his hair. Looks like his head is covered with curly grass.)

> "Bla bla bla"(是呀,你是对的.看他的发型.就像他头上堆着一堆乱草.)

At this, both of them again started guffawing with tears in their eyes.

> 这时,她们两个开始笑得都掉眼泪了.

“Itni badsurat shakal kisi ki kese ho sakti hai!” (How can somebody have such an ugly face!)

> "Bla bla bla "(一个人怎么可以长这么丑!(Tips:那是因为你们没遇见我 笑))

I was really embarrassed. Was this my incredible India?

> 我十分尴尬.这还是我的大印度吗?(Absolutely)

The lift stopped. The African guy adjusted his backpack and proceeded to step out. Then suddenly, he turned around, and in impeccable Hindi, said -

> 电梯停了.非洲同胞调整了一下他的背包,然后走出电梯.忽然,他转过身来,用24k纯正印度语说:

“Badsurat dil hone se to badsurat shakal hona achha hai!” (It’s better to have an ugly face than an ugly heart!)

> "Bla bla bla"(面丑也比心丑好呀!!!)

And then, he was gone.

> 然后,他就没了.(叫你拽,敢顶地头蛇,问你死没?)

The expression of utter shame and embarrassment on the girls’ faces, turned red with rage and humiliation, is something I still cherish to this day.

Three encounters with one of my ex-classmates:

> 我一个前同学做了以下三件事:

I bought a new computer after a long wait. She came home to see it. And as I turned on the system, she immediately said, "Waste. It's pretty slow.

> 在等了很久之后,我买到了我的新电脑.她来到我的家看电脑.当我打开电脑系统的时候,她立刻说:"浪费钱,太慢了."

I said I'm gonna join for M.Tech, and she responded, "Now every fool does that".

> 我说我要加入M.Tech,然后她回答,"现在做这个都很傻".

My teeth were misaligned and I wore braces for sometime to correct it. After a year, when the braces were taken off, she visited me, and her first response was, "12k just went in vain, you don't have any change."

> 我的牙齿不太整齐,所以我一段时间带着牙套来纠正它.一年后,当那个牙套拿掉的时候,她来拜访我,然后她的第一句回复就是,"12k就那样子没了,看不出来你有任何变化."

Yes may be my brand new system was slow, may be MTech has become common is what she meant, may be there was no great change in me after braces. But when somebody invests on something, you cannot invalidate the whole purpose with statements like these.

> 是的,或许我新版本的系统很慢,或许MTech就像她说的那样变得平常,或许在摘掉牙套之后没有太大的改变.但当某些人投资一些东西的时候,你不能用这样的语气来使整一个目的都无效.


This is something I have never done. And this, I believe nobody should ever do. Stay positive, spread positivity !! :)

> 这是我之前没做过的事.而且我认为没人会这么做.保持乐观,散播正能量(If you mean the chickensoup, then I don't give fuck.)

Edit: This answer was in no way intended to demean my friend's character. I don't want to spread that message either. :)

Years ago, I was the Chief Customs Officer on duty at a major border crossing.

> 一年前,我还是一个在主要边境的海关官员.

This was post 9/11, and we were all still a little numb, anxious to somehow make a difference in the war on terrorism and to protect the homeland.

> 在11月9日的报道之后,我们有点麻木,着急着想在面对恐怖袭击的战争中做一些改变来保护国土.

One afternoon a man in his mid-fifties was crossing the border when his name alerted for possible ties to terrorism. The man was a naturalized U.S. citizen, having been born in a Middle-East country. During this time, our “system” was rife with false positives—folks that might have the same or similar name with a known terrorist or someone with ties to terrorism. Sometimes, they might even have the same birthday, and yet not be the suspect in question.

> 一天下午,一名50多岁的男子在通过边境的时候,他的名字显示他可能恐怖袭击组织有关.这个男人是一个移民到美国的公民,在中东的国家出生.在这段时间里,我们的系统充斥着虚假的假设——那些可能与已知恐怖分子或与恐怖主义有联系的人有着相同或相似名字的人.有时,他们甚至可能是同一天生日,但不是嫌疑犯.

Per our standard operating procedures (SOPs), this man was handcuffed, escorted into our secondary inspection area and subjected to a personal search.

> 按照我们的标准操作流程(SOPs),我们给他戴上了手铐,护送他到我们的第二个检查处并进行个人搜查.

Also per our SOPs, this individual was isolated for further questioning.

> 同时根据我们的标准流程,这个人会单独接受更多的审问.

Now, all of this was done without my personal knowledge. That’s the purpose of SOPs, so certain critical situations are all handled in a specific way, according to a specific standard, even when a supervisor is not on scene to direct operations.

> 现在,在我不知情的情况下,这些全都完成了.这就是SOPs的目的,因此,某些关键的情况都是以一种特定的方式来处理的,根据一个特定的标准，,使一个主管不在现场指挥操作.

However, that’s no excuse. I was in charge, and I was responsible for the treatment this individual received.

> 不论怎样,这里没有借口推脱.我正在掌管这里,而我得为这个人管理作出回应.

While walking through the station, I observed this man, sitting handcuffed in an isolated area, guarded by two armed officers and waiting for an officer with specialty training to question him regarding any possible ties to terrorism. This, in and of itself, was not particularly unusual. It was also a part of our SOPs.

> 当我走过警察站的时候,我观察那个男人,手铐锁着坐在单独的拘留室里面,被两个武装警察看管,等待着一名有专业训练的警官来询问他是否与恐怖主义有任何联系,这本身并不是特别不寻常.这也是我们SOPs的一部分.

What immediately struck me as unusual, however, was that this man was silently crying, tears flowing down his face. I stopped outside the isolation room and asked one of the officers to brief me on the situation, which he did.

> 是什么突然间要把我牵扯进去,不论怎样,那个男人还是在默默的流着泪,泪水划过他的脸庞.我站在拘留室的外边,询问其中一个警官向我简单介绍一下现在的情况,他做了什么.

I then entered the room and sat opposite the man. I asked him, “What’s wrong? Are you in pain?”

> 然后我走进那间房间,坐在那个男人的对面.我问他,"有什么问题吗?你是不是不舒服?"

“No,” he answered simply.

> "不是的,"他简洁的回答.

There was something about his demeanor, like he had been betrayed and injured in some way.

> 那些有一些关于他的举止神色的东西,就像他曾被背叛和伤害过.

I asked him, “Is there something you need? Something I can do for you?”

> 我问他,"你有什么需要的没?我有什么可以帮你的没?"

“My wallet,” he said. “Look in my wallet.”

> "我的钱包,"他说,"看一下我的钱包."

His wallet lay on the desk in front of me, the result of the officers’ emptying of his pockets as part of the search for weapons.

> 他的钱包摆放在我前面的桌子上,因为警察需要清空他的行李来检查是否携带有武器.

I opened his wallet and emptied the contents onto the desk. “There,” he nodded toward a folded newspaper article that had tumbled out of his wallet. “There, read the paper.”

> 我打开他的钱包,把里面所有的东西倒到桌子上."那里,"他指向从他钱包里面掉出来的那份折叠好的报纸."那,看那张报纸."

I unfolded a worn piece of newsprint. It was an article that told of a small-town young man who had enlisted in the U.S. Army, only 19 years old. He had been killed in the line of duty in Iraq just a few months earlier.

> 我打开那张报纸.那是一篇文章告诉一个来自小镇的年轻人应征入伍的消息,仅仅19岁.他几个月前在执勤的时候被伊斯兰恐怖组织杀害.

I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the young soldier’s last name was the same as that of the man who sat, handcuffed, in front of me.

> 我背后感到一股凉意,当我意识到那个年轻士兵的姓氏和正在坐在我前面,被手铐锁住,坐在我前面的男人的姓氏是一模一样的.

“That my son, that my son (sic),” he sobbed, as tears again flowed freely down his cheeks. “My son, he die for this country! HE DIE FOR THIS COUNTRY!” More sobs. “I … I love this country. I love my son … my son … my son.”

> "那个是我的孩子,我的孩子,"他抽泣着,眼泪在他的脸颊上横流."我的孩子,他为这个国家牺牲了.他为这个国家牺牲了."更大声的痛哭."我...我爱这个国家.我爱我的孩子,...我的孩子...,我的孩子"

I had been around. I had heard hundreds, maybe thousands of stories in my 30-plus years in Customs. Nothing had ever affected me in this way.

> 我一直都在海关这边.我听过数百上千的故事,在我过去的30多年的海关生涯里面.没有一个故事能像这个那样子影响我.

“Uncuff this man,” I instructed one of the officers. “But Chief,” he objected until I cut him off with a wave of my hand.

> "解开这个男人的手铐,"我指示其中的一个警官."但是长官,"他拒绝直到我用手势打断他的说话.

“Never mind,” I said. I told the silently crying man to stand and turn around so I could uncuff him.

> "不要介意",我对那个警官说.我告诉那个默默流泪的男人站起来,转身,那样子我就可以解开他的手铐了.

Afterward he just turned back around and sat back down on the hard back chair. He stared straight ahead, a blank expression on his face.

> 在他转身,重新坐回那张椅子的时候.他直视着前方,面无表情.

“I am sorry for your loss,” I told him. “I know that this means less than nothing to you now, but I am so sorry for your loss.”

> "我对你儿子的逝世感到遗憾,"我告诉他."我知道我的同情对比与你的失去,一点也没有用,但我真的对你的失去很遗憾."

He stared at me for a long moment, maybe twenty seconds. He reached out his hands towards me, and I grasped his forearms as he grasped mine. We sat and cried together, silently. The two officers looked on, clearly uncomfortable, unsure what to do.

> 他盯着我看了一会,或许有20s.他把他的手伸向我,我拉住他的前臂,就像他拉住我的一样.我们站着哭了起来,沉默着.两个警官看着我们,十分不自然,又不知道能做什么.
