## 你从没对别人说过的事是什么?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What's something you've never told anyone?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-something-youve-never-told-anyone/answer/Sailaja-Kumar-1?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: January 09 2018



It was 2007. I moved from Andhra Pradesh to Tamilnadu (Chennai) for job. I stayed in a ladies hostel with four of my roommates from my location. I did not know Tamil during that period. I was new to the language, culture and people. I was the kind of a girl who stays indoor, silent and reserved.

> 那是2007年的时候.我为了工作从Andhra Pradesh移居到Tamilnadu(Chennai).我和四个来自我们那块地方的室友住在一间女士酒店里面.在那期间,我对Tamil一点也不了解.我也是刚接触那边的语言,文化和当地的人.我也是那种宅女,寡言高冷的那种.(牛逼咯,The Queen)

On Dec 31st, one of my roommates found a new hostel (due to some problems at old one) for us and she spoke to the new hostel warden (run by two ladies) and told us that we are leaving that evening to the new hostel. We were happy because we did not have to stay in the old hostel anymore .

> 在12月31的时候,我们的一个室友找到了一个新的酒店(应对在现在这个酒店里面存在的问题),她和新酒店的经营者(由两个女士经营),然后告诉我们傍晚搬到新酒店.我们很开心因为我们不用被逼的待在这个旧的酒店了.

In, the evening, we packed our luggage and booked two auto rickshaws and started to the new hostel. Before leaving, confidently, my roommate fought with the old hostel warden for not providing good facilities.

> 在傍晚的时候,我们收拾好我们的行李,预订了两台面包车(不管,你喜欢什么就叫什么吧)然后准备去新的酒店.在离开之前,我们迷之自信,我的舍友为酒店不提供好的设备和酒店管理员争吵.

I was happy that, the next day is new year and we have some good plans and vows to start the year. When we reached the new hostel, the lady my friend dealt with, was not there. She was out of town and the one who was there does not know anything about our visit. She told no vacancy. We were shocked and tried convincing her but of no help. As we are nearly freshers (new to job) with less money in hand, new place, new language… OMG…two of our friends started crying. Imagine us, on December 31st night (nearly at around 8PM), we were on the platform with our luggage.

> 我对这次争吵感到高兴(瓜子,西瓜都准备好了),然后第二天就是新年了,我们有一些很好的关于新年的计划.当我们到新酒店的时候,那个负责处理的朋友不在那里(被卖了吧).她已经不在这边了,然后酒店管理的人员完全不知道我们会来.她告诉我们没有空余的房间了.我们表示震惊然后尝试说服她给我们提供房间,但并没什么卵用.那会我们都是刚入职的手里没什么钱的菜鸟,新的地方,新的语言,....窝草,...我有两个朋友都已经泪流满面了.想象一下我们,在12月31日(差不多晚上8点),我们带着我们的行李在地铁站里面.


We were so panicked and looking for some help. The problem was, we never shared this to our parents yet, about the hostel change.

> 我们很恐慌,然后想寻求他人帮助.问题是,我们还没对我们的父母说过关于换酒店的事情.

Then, one of my colleagues saw us on the road and came. He asked about everything and offered us help. He took us to stay in his apartment, for that night. There were few others guys staying there along with him. With no other choice, we went in and stayed at that night. But, we were very uncomfortable there. That is a bachelor’s room (one like below).

> 然后,一个我们的同事看见我们在路上然后过来.他问我们有什么可以帮我们的没.为了应对那晚的情况,他把我们带到他们的公寓里面.那里还有少数的几个臭男人在和他在一起.没有其他的选项了,我们到他的公寓然后在那里度过今晚.但,我们觉得很不舒服.那是单身狗的房间呀.(该)


Most of us didn't sleep that night but to be frank, they were good and friendly. They offered us good food and shelter. They made us to stay as comfortable as possible. That night around 12AM, my parents, siblings and friends called me to wish “Happy New Year”. I was into tears on each call as I was hiding something from them. They do not know about this incident till now.

> 我们大多数都没能睡着,但实话说,他们真的是好人.他们给我们提供了好的食物和床单.他们让我们过得尽量舒服.那晚差不多12点的时候,我的父母和兄弟还有朋友打电话给我说"Happy new year".我每一个电话都含着泪水,在我还藏着这些事没让他们知道.他们直到现在也不知道那件事.

The next day, he (the person who offered stay), searched a ladies hostel for us and we moved to that place immediately. We thanked him from the heart.

> 第二天,他(那个为我们提供帮助的单身狗),找到一间女生酒店给我们,然后我们立刻搬了进去.我们打心底的感谢他.

The incident changed most of ours way of thinking. All guys are not bad :)

> 这件事改变了我们的想法.不是所有的男的都是坏的:")(Give hime times)

## 有哪些严重被低估的优点?
From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the single most underrated trait a person can have?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-single-most-underrated-trait-a-person-can-have/answer/Haily-Cramer?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: January 10 2018



What did I realize was an underrated trait?

> 为什么我会认为那是一个被低估的特点?

I had to take one of the hardest undergraduate college courses at my university. This course had a higher rate of failing students than passing. Everyone said it was the professor's fault students would fail.

> 我在大学的时候,我上一门很难的课程.这门课程挂科的比通过的多得多.学生挂科,其他人都说是教授的错.


The first day, the professor warned our class of 300 students that this was not a course you could pass by studying the night before. I laughed and thought, “how ludicrous…” Every one of my teachers had said the exact same thing, and I would always ace the class.

> 那门课的第一节课,那个教授警告班里面的300多个学生,这不是一门你们考前前一晚复习就能通过的课程.我笑了,然后想了想,"扯淡吧..."每一个我的老师都说一样的东西,而我一直是班里面的学霸(这里要有掌声?)

I studied for the test the night before... and I failed it. I had never had this happen. I did the math, and came to the realization the best possible grade I could now receive in the class was a "C". I would not qualify for the competitive nursing program I wanted. I also did not have enough money to retake the course.

> 我在测试的前一晚才学习,然后我挂掉了.我之前从来没试过.我运算了那些算术,然后自我感觉我在班级里面可以得到最好的成绩,而现在我只得到了"C".我没有获得我想要的竞赛资格.同时,我也没钱去重修这门课.

I was mortified. I did not want to walk in front of my 300 classmates and have them see my professor sign my drop slip.

> 我很窘迫.我不想在300多个同学面前,给他们看见教授在我的签名栏签名.

I decided to email my professor:

> 所以我觉得给我教授发邮件:

You and I have never met. That is my fault... I wanted to tell you that I am dropping your course. It is my fault I am failing. Could we possibly meet in your office to have you sign my drop slip? I am really embarrassed. Things will be different the next time around. However, due to financial reasons, I won't be retaking this course until next year.

> 我们之前没单独会过面.这是我的错....我想告诉你我把你的课程挂掉了.我挂掉全是因为我的错.我们可以在你的办公室见面吗,让你在我的签名栏签名?真的好尴尬.第二轮会变得不一样的了.不论怎样,因为经济原因,我只能在明年才能再次选修这门课程.

He replied, and told me to talk to him after class. Thinking nothing of it, I waited until my peers left and approached him with my slip.

> 他回复了,然后告诉我在下课之后去和他谈话.我对此毫无想法,我等着,直到我的同学离开,然后带着我的签名纸去找他.

Professor: "Are you Haily?"

> 教授:"你是Haily?"

Me: "I am. Here is my drop-slip."

> 我:"是的.这个是我的签名纸."

Professor: "Your email was a breath of fresh air. Do you know how many times the students blame me for failing my course even though I tell them exactly what they need to do to pass? I'm going to sign an incomplete slip, instead. This will allow you to retake the class next semester at no charge. However, you have to read the book and attend every one of the class study sessions... and don’t just study the night before. Please, don't make me regret my decision."

> 教授:"你的邮件就像一口新鲜的空气.你知道多少次那些学生因为自己挂科责怪我,即使我告诉他们需要怎么去做才能通过考试?我会签你一张没完成的签名,来代替你挂科的签名.这会允许你在下学期重新学这门课.不论怎样,你一定要去看那些书,然后参加每一节课.然后不要以为在考前复习就可以了.不要让我为自己的决定后悔."

I was flabbergasted. I did not deserve what he did. This experience helped me form study habits to be successful in college. With hard work, I did eventually ace the class.

> 我目瞪狗呆.我配不上他为我所做的.这次经历帮我帮我养成了在大学成功的学习习惯.在努力学习下,我最终在班里面拿到了A.

What I realized was an underrated trait: the ability to apologize and admit you are wrong.

> 我意识到一个被低估的特点: 去道歉的能力和承认你自己是错的.

This experience was extremely humbling. I am prideful, and I'm awful at apologizing.

> 这个经历是十分羞辱人的.我很骄傲,同时我不太会道歉.

I highly respect individuals who are able to apologize. It is hard for any person to admit their faults.

> 我很尊敬那么能自动去道歉的人.这对每个来说,承认自己的错都是很难的.

It's a trait that is extremely underrated; instead of making a person look weak, it shows tact and strength.

> 这个优点是被严重低估的.看起来一个人示弱,这是聪明和力量的展现.

Date: January 11 2018



I am a 13-year-old boy raised by modern feminists. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom and sister.

> 我是一个被现代女权抚养长大的13岁的男孩.我的父母已经离婚了,我和母亲还有妹妹一起生活.

I wish I had good things to say about my childhood. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

> 我希望我说一些关于童年好的回忆.不幸的是,事实并不是这样.

The other day, my sister asked my mother what she would do If she told her she kissed a boy.

> 有一天,我的妹妹问我妈如果她在学校吻了一个小屁孩,她(我妈)会怎么做.

This question was asked merely out of curiosity.

> 这个问题只是出于好奇.

My mother told her she would sit down and talk with her. She wouldn’t be angry or yell, but they would discuss consequences.

> 我妈告诉我妹,她会坐下来和我妹好好谈一下.她不会对这个生气或者责骂,但她们会讨论一下这件事.

I was suddenly curious too.

> 忽然,我也很好奇.

“Mom what would you do if I told you I kissed a girl?” I asked.

> "如果我告诉你吻了一个小屁孩(女的),你会怎么做?"我问道.

“Honey, that’s called rape,” she replied while glaring at me.

> "honey,那叫强奸(我承认,我笑了)"当她用余光不屑的看着我的回答.

I was distraught and felt that this was unfair.

> 我觉得愤怒,而且感觉这很不公平.

Double standards like this are a daily occurrence.

> 这是日常双标呀.

If I asked my sister to bring me a cup of water, my mother would tell me that I'm sexist to expect everything of a woman.

> 如果我叫我妹给我倒一杯水,我妈会告诉我,对女性期待任何东西都是性别歧视.(窝草,不能忍的双标狗)

On the other hand, if my sister asks me to do something for her, my mother turns a blind eye.

> 另一方面,如果我妹叫我为她做些什么事,我妈就假装看不见.

If I mention anything about how unfair this is, they would call me a sexist, misogynistic pig.

> 如果我提及所有关于这些有多么不公平,她们会告诉我这是性别歧视,我是歧视女性的猪.

Meanwhile, they joke about how men can’t survive without women in their lives.

> 同时,她们拿男人如果没有女人根本活不下去来开玩笑.

If this is what feminism looks like, then I don’t want it.

> 如果这些就是所谓的女权主义,我宁愿不要女权主义.

I want to be equal as my sister.

> 我想和我妹一样被公平对待.

I want to be treated fairly.

> 我希望被公平对待.

Why is that so difficult?

> 为什么这些那么难?





## 你为什么取消婚礼?

From:  [Why did you call off your wedding?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-you-call-off-your-wedding/answers/67067066?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: January 12 2018



I was to get married to this guy in September. Ours was an intense romance. My parents were against our marriage and gave me hell for a long time (almost all the time I was in a relationship with this guy).

> 我和这个男在9月份结婚了.我们之间很,很,很浪漫.我的父母一直反对这门婚姻而且不给我好的脸色看(几乎在我和他确定关系的这段时间都没给我好脸色看).

He was generous, kind and very loving. He was in the Army and doing very well professionally. His parents really liked me and I used to meet them all the time. My own parents didn’t like this at all.

> 他很慷慨,热心和十分热爱.他在军队里面也做得十分好.在和他们家庭聚会的时候,他的父母亲也挺喜欢我的.但我的父母一点也不喜欢这门婚事.

Eventually my parents gave up the battle and agreed to get us married. For the first time in two years, I thought I could breathe easy now. My parents got off my back and my guy was really happy too. Everything seemed to be falling in place now.

> 最后我的父母放弃了这场战斗然后同意我们结婚.在两年来,我第一次感到呼吸没那么沉重了.我的父母不拖我的后腿,我告诉你,那是真正的开心呀.所有的事情看起来步入正轨.

Except this prickling at the back of my neck. And no matter how much I tried, it just didn’t budge.

> 除了从我颈背传来的刺痛感.无论我多么努力尝试,那么刺痛感一直挥之不去.

During this time, I realised some things about our relationship. These are the reasons why I called off my wedding:

> 在这期间,我意识到我们关系之间的一些东西.这些是我为什么取消婚礼的原因:

a. My guy was a rally racer. He used to drive exceptionally well. I was still learning how to drive back then. When we would ride together, he’d do stunts with the car and then ask me casually, “Hey, babe.. you could never make such turns on a crowded road, could you?”
I used to wear a bracelet which was a simple chain with a heart dangling on it. He took it one day and engraved his initials on it. Without asking me.

> 我的男朋友是赛车手.他习惯开得出乎异常的好.我那会还在学开车.当我们一起开车的时候,他会用车来表演,然后(假装无意的问起我),"hey,babe....你不可能在拥堵的主交通道路里面做这个动作,是吧?"我之前习惯带着一条项链上面有一个心形的吊坠.然后刻入她的首字母在那里.甚至根本没有问过我.

b. When back from parties, he would rave about how I was the prettiest girl in the party and how every guy checked me out. How jealous they all must be.

> 当从聚会回来,他会吼着说在聚会上我是多么漂亮的一个女孩子,那些男的是怎样看着我.他们有多么的妒忌.

c. He resented that I earned more than him. It pissed him off, visibly so. I worked for a corporate and earned well. He would, however, accept the expensive gifts I gave him. I also paid for his travelling often. He was generally short of money because he used to party a lot.

> 他憎恨我收入比他多.显然易见,这让他觉得有点操蛋.我为一家公司工作,而且收入很好.他可以,不论怎样,接受那些我给他昂贵的礼物.我还经常为他的旅行付账.他经常缺钱,因为他经常去参加聚会.

d. He disliked it if I hung out with my (male) friends. He once said to me, “You are out on a drive with a guy at 10 in the night. In a car.” I was out for dinner with a very good friend of mine who I’d known for years. He was dropping me back to my place. My friend heard his shrieking. He had the decency to not mention it.

> 他不喜欢我跟男性朋友玩(那你喜欢他跟女性朋友玩吗?).有一次他对我说,"你竟然在晚上10点和一个男的坐一辆车."当时我和一个很好的朋友出去吃饭,那个朋友我都认识一年多了.他把我运回我的地方.我朋友听到他的责问.但我朋友为了避免我尴尬没有去提及过.


So, in January, I gave him an ultimatum. I told him to mend his ways or I will leave. He said to me, “Everyone knows that we are dating. See, I’m a guy. I’ll be okay. If you leave me, who will marry you?”

> 所在,在1月份,我给了他最后的一次机会.我告诉他要改正他的行为,否则我会离开他.他告诉我,"每个人都知道我们在约会,你知道的,我是男的.我没什么影响.但你离开,谁还会娶你?"(被爱的有恃无恐)


It’s been 4 years since that decision. At the time, I couldn’t explain why I was doing what I was doing ~ Making a decision. Going crazy to defend my decision. Doing a complete 360 when everyone agreed to my decision. My parents were so shocked they didn’t speak. They didn’t retort. They didn’t ask me why. They just stayed silent.

> 做出那个决定后已经四年了.在那时候我都不清楚我在做什么~下决策.疯狂的不改变自己的决定.然后转变其他人对我的态度来支持我的决定.我的父母震惊到不能说话.他们没有和我争执.甚至都没问我原因.他们仅仅沉默不语.(哀莫大于心死)

To say that it was a humiliating experience would be an understatement.

> 这样来陈述一个尴尬的经历是一件轻描淡写的事.

In the bargain, I saved myself from marrying a chauvinist, egoist, macho-maniac who had zero financial intelligence. I also learnt that loving someone does not mean being the second wheel. You cannot ride shotgun your entire life. And even when we ride with someone on the rails of life, we still must carefully stoke our own engines too.

> 在这场交易里面,我保护我自己不嫁给一个自私的男权,还tmd经济头脑为0的人.我同时学会了去爱某个人并不意味着要放弃自我.你不可能在你一辈子都开得那么快的.即使我们和其他人一起在人生的道路上奔驰,我们依然要很小心我们自己的引擎是否太过头了.

## 今天哪些事情让你惊喜?
From:  [What surprised you today?](https://www.quora.com/What-surprised-you-today/answers/50144271?srid=uv7Kg)


Date: January 17 2018




I was feeling very suicidal for the past few days and I showed up to work feeling very hopeless and down. I am a preschool teacher so it takes everything I have to put a “happy act” on for the kids everyday. With this particular day being one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was terrified of being alone with my thoughts so I didn't call in sick. I showed up and walked into the classroom trying to smile and pretend I didn't want to end my life. As soon as I walked in something unexpected happened. About 6 preschoolers came running at me giving me hugs and holding on tight to my legs. Then more came running and this one little girl looked me in the eyes and said “I love you Miss Sara” as she gave me a hug. This created a chain reaction of kisses and hugs from all my little ones, all saying I love you… almost as if they knew how I was feeling. Immediately I had to fight back tears and stop myself from breaking down. In that moment I could physically feel the love and I knew that even though I did not want to live, I had to for these kids. And I finally felt like I could breathe again. Like purpose just got put back into my life. I never knew how much of an impact I had on these kids lives.

> 前些天,我感觉我有自杀的倾向,在工作的时候我感觉毫无希望和失落.我是一个幼儿园的老师,所以不得不每天都为那些小屁孩装作开心的样子.在这一阵子,最糟糕的一天里面,我对独自面对自己的想法感到害怕,所以我没有请假,还继续去上课.我准时上班,然后走进课室里面,我尝试去笑一下,然后假装我不想结束我的绳命(嗯,绳命)一样.就在我走进教室的那会,一些意料外的事发生了.差不多6个小屁孩跑向我,跑过来抱着我,抱着我的腿.然后其他的小屁孩也跑过来了,然后一个小女孩在抱着我的时候,看着我说"I love you,Miss sara".这好像从小屁孩里面的轻吻和拥抱里面创建了一个链式反应,全都说我爱你....就像ta们知道我的感受一样.我好不容易忍住了眼泪,然后让自己停止处于崩溃状态.在那一刻,我亲身感受到爱,即使在我不想活下去的情况下,我必须为这些小屁孩做些什么.我终于感觉可以再次呼吸了.就像从新把生活的意义塞进我的生命里面.我从不知道这些小屁孩对我有这么大的影响.


This little yet significant surprise made a huge difference not only in my day, but my life.

## 你曾经承担过最大的风险,现在收获了什么?

At 27 I ignored all the thoughtful, experienced, well meaning and loving advice my mother and father, friends, and neighbors heaped on me and said “Yes” when a scruffy, unemployed, homeless guy I’d only met 3 months earlier asked me to marry him. The general consensus was, “She’s out of her mind, it won’t last a year, he’ll take everything she’s got and leave her flat.”

> 在我27岁的时候,我忽略了我父母,朋友,邻居给予我所有慎重考虑的,经历过的,出于好心和爱我的建议,对一个邋遢,无家可归,失业,我们只认识3个月,早前叫我嫁给他的人说了"Yes".ta们舆论一般是,"她一定是傻掉了,最多不能保持一年,他就会带走她所有的东西,只留下地板给她."

How did that risk work out? 35 years later I’m still out of my mind in love, he stole my heart and gave me his in return. He cleaned up pretty good, got a job, went back to college, got his degree, graduated Phi Theta Kappa. Got a better job. He took care of both my parents when they were ill, rebuilt our family home by hand when it burned in a fire. Has nursed me when I was sick, when I was injured in a bad fall and thought I’d never walk again, he told me, “H*** yes you’ll walk, you're a tough stubborn lady, now lean on me and lets do more of that therapy”. 6 months later I was walking without a cane. When he got hurt himself later, I stood by him exactly the same.

> 最后这个风险怎样了?在那35年后,我一直都像傻掉一样爱着,他偷走了我的心,把他的心放到了我的里面.他把自己整理干净,找到一份工作,重新回到学校里面,拿到了学位,在Phi Theta Kappa里面毕业.得到一份更好的工作.他在我父母生病的时候照顾好他们,亲手重建我们在火灾里面被烧毁的房子.在我生病的时候,他照料我,当我受伤躺在床上,想我永远也不能再次行走的时候,他告诉我,"草他的,你会自己走的,你可是很坚强的女人呀,现在走向我,来做多一些治疗".半年后,我可以不用拐杖就可以自己行走了.在之后,他受伤的时候,我在他身边做着他对我做的事.

He’s never failed to make me laugh my butt off at his cornball jokes and says making me smile at least twice a day his life’s mission. Defends me against all comers. He both emotionally and financially supported both me and my family during the tough times when my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimers . Yeah, it was a risk, a good risk and I’ve never regretted it.

> 他的粗俗笑话从来都会让我笑到怀疑人生,而且说每天让我最少笑两次是他一生的任务.保护我对抗那些带着恶意的人.他在我家庭处于我爸被确诊为老年痴呆症的艰难时刻在精神和经济上支持我.是的,当初这个是冒险,一个好的冒险,而我从来没后悔过.(我拒绝这样的狗粮,在星期一,星期二,星期三,星期四,星期五,星期六和星期天)

Today I was in Gloucester, doing my driving test.

> 今天我在Gloucester,进行驾驶测试(考驾驶证吧,我想).

I gave a homeless guy some change, about fifty pence - I try to give something if I can. Later on I saw the same homeless guy smoking a cigarette. And my first thought was basically: ‘Oh, so you're wasting my money on fags? You should buy yourself food with that.’

> 我把一些零钱给了一个流浪汉,大概50便士-我想把我一些能给的给他.晚一点之后,我看见那个流浪汉正在那里抽烟.而我的第一想法差不多:"啊,所以你把我的钱浪费在香烟上面了?你应该给你自己买一点食物的."

And then I evaluated that thought. It said a lot about me. Firstly, despite the fact that I gave him the money freely, I felt like I should have control over its use, and I still felt like it was my money. What's more, I felt a desire to govern his behavior. On some level I felt like the fact I gave him money meant I had a say in his behaviour. Finally, I assumed I knew better than him; that food was what he needed, when, in reality, cigarettes may be the only luxury he has in life.

> 然后我开始审视我的想法.这对我说明了很多东西.首先,令人沮丧的是我给了ta钱,我就想来控制他对钱的使用,同时我还在想那是我的钱.更多的是,我觉得我应该要去纠正他的行为.在某些方面来说,我感觉我给了他那些钱,然后我必须要对他的行为说些什么.最后,我假设我自己才是比他更了解他自己的人.那些食物是他要的吗?当在现实里面,香烟对他来说才是他最奢侈的享受呢?

I stood there and, even if only for a moment, felt like this homeless guy, who has nothing, was slighting me by engaging in a perfectly normal behaviour. All because I did what I felt was a kind act.

> 我站在那里,尽管只有那一会,就想那个流浪汉一样,对他人来说他谁也不是,完全忽视我自己一个正常完美的帮助他人的行为.全都是因为我做了我以为是好的事.

Today, the realisation that I am not as altruistic as I thought I was made me sad.

> 今天,我不是像我想的那样无私去帮助别人,这让我有点伤心.

He took my car. I gave him because he was one of the guys whom I could trust that he won't collide anywhere by my car.

> 他借走了我的车.我借给他是因为他是我信任不会拿我的车乱撞的人.

The first time I was giving my car to someone, just because I was unable to drive.

He came after some 6 hours and handed me the keys.

> 6小时后,他换回车钥匙给我.

“You're so late, man”, I said.

> "你太晚了",我说.

“I was at home, decided to give you the car at night as you weren't going anywhere”, He replied.

> "我待在家里面,打算在你不回去其他地方的晚上把车还回给你",他回答道.

“Alright.”

> "好吧"

2 days later, I decided to go out, hence took the car out of the garage.

> 2天后,我决定出去外边,因此我把车弄出车库.

I started it and saw the fuel meter. I could see very low amount of fuel in the meter.

I spent 600 rupees filling the fuel 4 days ago and I hardly drove 10 km after that.

> 在4天前,我花费了600来加满油箱,而我自己驾驶还不到10公里

Then, oh yes, who took my car 2 days ago?

> 然后,窝草,谁两天前把我的车拿走了?

I realised it. I didn't say anything to him, though I burst out in anger and cursed myself.

> 我意识到这个.我不会对他说任何的东西,尽管我很生气和埋怨我自己.

When you borrow someone's vehicle, fill the tank up when you return the vehicle. It is decency.

> 当你借走别人的车的时候,加满油再还回来.这才是得体的.

If you can't, DON'T TAKE IT. It's that simple.

A 97 year old Japanese woman visits a nearby Buddhist temple every evening to pray, and ring the bell until the sun sets. On one of my own routine visits, I lay inconspicuously near the stairs listening to the vibrations take over the silent winter evening. Only this day I failed to wake up before she finished, and soon found myself at the end of her walking stick.

> 一个97岁的日本女生(Yeah,you heard me)每晚都去她附近的Buddhist庙里面祈祷,敲响钟铃知道夕阳沉下去.在一个我日常的访问里面,我轻轻的坐在阶梯上听着钟声带走这个冬日的傍晚.也只有这天我在她完成后我没从沉思中反应过来,然后发现我挡在她拐杖的前面了.

“Would you like some tea?” I was asked, while she strutted down the stairs without waiting for an answer.

> "你介意和我喝一点茶吗? :")"她问我,当她走下阶梯时,却不等待我的回复.

Soon, I was being served matcha (Japanese powdered green tea) in her living room, as we talked away for half an hour or so before she looked at me and uttered these words-

> 一会之后,我在她的居室里面喝着matcha(日式粉末绿茶),在我们说了一个半小时后,或者在她看向我之前,她说出了这些话

> "我曾看见我的孩子和孙在我逝世之前就离开了,但真正让我难过的是我过去的每一年的每一天,他们在我的记忆里面,越来越模糊."(Alen)

The fragility of life that hangs in those words is truly terrifying. Being this young and strong, it’s hard to comprehend the intensity of her helplessness.

Consider, for example, "We can do it this way, but it'll be way too expensive given our budget," versus "We can do it this way, and if we do, we'll need to cut back on other important features." The first indicates that we can't even consider the option. The second acknowledges possibility and describes consequences.

> 考虑一下,比如,"我们可以这样子做,但这会花费我们很多的钱,"相对应的是,"我们可以这样子做,如果我们这样子做,我们需要削减其他的重要部分开支".第一个表明我们甚至都不能考虑那个意见.第二个可能会被承认同时造成一系列好的影响.

"But" is exclusive and isolating, "and" is inclusive and welcoming.

> "But"是排出和孤立,"And"是包容和欢迎.(And fuck you ,you piece of shit)

She was absolutely right, and it's advice I have used with great success for the past 30 years of my life.

> 她绝壁是对的,同时这个意见在过去的30年里边,使我获得了巨大的成功.
